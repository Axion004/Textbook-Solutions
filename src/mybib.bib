 abstract = {Singular integrals are among the most interesting and important objects of study in analysis, one of the three main branches of mathematics. They deal with real and complex numbers and their functions. In this book, Princeton professor Elias Stein, a leading mathematical innovator as well as a gifted expositor, produced what has been called the most influential mathematics text in the last thirty-five years. One reason for its success as a text is its almost legendary presentation: Stein takes arcane material, previously understood only by specialists, and makes it accessible even to beginning graduate students. Readers have reflected that when you read this book, not only do you see that the greats of the past have done exciting work, but you also feel inspired that you can master the subject and contribute to it yourself.Singular integrals were known to only a few specialists when Stein's book was first published. Over time, however, the book has inspired a whole generation of researchers to apply its methods to a broad range of problems in many disciplines, including engineering, biology, and finance.Stein has received numerous awards for his research, including the Wolf Prize of Israel, the Steele Prize, and the National Medal of Science. He has published eight books with Princeton, includingReal Analysisin 2005.},

year = {2013},
isbn = {1611972582},
publisher = {Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics},
address = {USA},
abstract = {This single-volume textbook covers the fundamentals of linear and nonlinear functional analysis, illustrating most of the basic theorems with numerous applications to linear and nonlinear partial differential equations and to selected topics from numerical analysis and optimization theory. This book has pedagogical appeal because it features self-contained and complete proofs of most of the theorems, some of which are not always easy to locate in the literature or are difficult to reconstitute. It also offers 401 problems and 52 figures, plus historical notes and many original references that provide an idea of the genesis of the important results, and it covers most of the core topics from functional analysis. Audience: Linear and Nonlinear Functional Analysis with Applications is intended for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers and is ideal for teaching or self-study. Contents: Preface; Chapter 1: Real analysis and theory of functions: A quick review; Chapter 2: Normed vector spaces; Chapter 3: Banach spaces; Chapter 4: Inner-product spaces and Hilbert spaces; Chapter 5: The great theorems of linear functional analysis; Chapter 6: Linear partial differential equations; Chapter 7: Differential calculus in normed vector spaces; Chapter 8: Differential geometry in Rn; Chapter 9: The great theorems of nonlinear functional analysis; Bibliographical notes; Bibliography; Main notations; Index.}

We show that these ODE correspond to the evolution inL2generated by the subdifferential of the convex functional which vanishes on functions whose gradient has length less than or equal to one and is infinity otherwise. Additionally we explain how the ODE arise from evolutions governed by thep-Laplacian in the â€œinfinitely fast/infinitely slowâ€ diffusion limit aspâ†’âˆž."
